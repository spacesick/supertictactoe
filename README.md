# Super Tictactoe

Super Tictactoe is a prototype of the classic Tictactoe game for the web with real-time online play and modifiable win conditions. This project is built using Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, Tailwind CSS, SockJS, and GraphQL. The app is deployed using Docker Compose. The source code was initially hosted in [GitLab](https://gitlab.cs.ui.ac.id/) and then moved here to be made available to the public.

The web app comprises three microservices: a primary service that serves the frontend of the app, a friend service that handles friend requests, and a game service that holds all the game logic.
